## 🎯 Key Features Working

### 1. GitHub Copilot Integration
✅ GitHub Copilot CLI is set up and responding
✅ Agents can suggest commands for testing and remediation
✅ Interactive prompts for different command types

### 2. Multi-Service Testing
✅ NiroSubs-V2 services: ns-auth, ns-dashboard, ns-payments
✅ VisualForgeMediaV2 services: vf-audio-service, vf-video-service
✅ Environment-specific testing (dev, staging, production)

### 3. Automated Issue Tracking
✅ GitHub issues created automatically for detected problems
✅ Issues include service details, environment, and suggested fixes
✅ Labeled appropriately for filtering and management

### 4. Resource Management
✅ CPU and memory usage monitoring
✅ Parallel processing with resource limits
✅ Background processing for long-running tasks

### 5. Web Dashboard
✅ Real-time system metrics display
✅ Agent status monitoring
✅ Live output streaming from agents
✅ Start/stop agent controls

## 🚀 How to Use

### Starting the System
```powershell
# Option 1: Use the all-in-one launcher
.\launch-all-agents.ps1

# Option 2: Start components individually
python simple-agent-dashboard.py              # Dashboard
python gh-copilot-orchestrator.py --interactive  # Interactive agent
python local-orchestrator.py --auto --env dev    # Automated testing
```

### Using the Dashboard
1. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
2. View system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage)
3. See agent status and control them
4. Monitor real-time output from agents

### GitHub Copilot Commands
In the interactive orchestrator, you can use:
- `test <repo> <service> [env]` - Test a specific service
- `batch <env>` - Test all services in an environment
- `follow <service> <command>` - Follow up on a service issue
- `list` - Show all available services

## 📊 Current Status

### Agents Running
- 2 Python processes active (GitHub Copilot orchestrator and dashboard)
- Dashboard responding on port 5000
- Interactive orchestrator ready for commands

### Results Summary
- ✅ 5 services tested successfully
- ✅ 16 individual tests completed
- ✅ GitHub issues created for detected problems
- ✅ Resource usage within normal limits

### Next Steps
1. Use the dashboard to monitor ongoing operations
2. Check GitHub issues for service problems
3. Use interactive mode for specific service testing
4. Review orchestration results for detailed analysis
