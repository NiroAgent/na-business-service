## 🎯 IMMEDIATE MISSION: AI Developer Agent

**Your next task is to create the AI Developer Agent that receives technical specifications from the AI Architect Agent and generates production-ready code.**

### 📋 PHASE 3 REQUIREMENTS

**File to Create:** `ai-developer-agent.py`

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Receive Technical Specifications** from AI Architect Agent
2. **Generate Production Code** based on architecture specifications
3. **Create File Structure** with proper organization
4. **Implement APIs** according to OpenAPI specifications
5. **Generate Database Schemas** and migrations
6. **Create Tests** (unit, integration, e2e)
7. **Generate Documentation** (README, API docs, deployment guides)
8. **Hand off to AI QA Agent** for testing and validation

### 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS

**Input Source:**
- AI Architect Agent specifications (JSON format)
- Technical requirements from design documents
- Architecture patterns and technology stack decisions

**Output Targets:**
- File system with generated code
- Git repository with proper structure
- Documentation and deployment instructions
- Handoff to AI QA Agent for validation

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
VF-Agent-Service → VF Bridge → AI Architect → [AI Developer] → AI QA → DevOps
```

### 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Provides progress updates and status

### 🔧 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT STATUS

**Active Services:**
- ✅ Visual Forge AI System (localhost:5006)
- ✅ PM Workflow System (localhost:5005)  
- ✅ Dashboard (localhost:5003) - **Fixed JS issues**
- ✅ AI Architect Agent - Ready to provide specifications

**Available Integrations:**
- VF Design Document Bridge working (71% success rate)
- Service monitoring active (vf-audio, vf-video, ns-auth, ns-dashboard)
- GitHub issues processing pipeline ready

### 📊 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

**UI Tests Created:** `dashboard-ui-tests.py`
- Tab navigation testing
- Data loading verification  
- Real-time updates validation
- Performance and stress testing
- API endpoint testing

**Run Tests:**
```bash
cd /e/Projects
python dashboard-ui-tests.py
```

### 🚀 START IMPLEMENTATION

**Your task:** Create `ai-developer-agent.py` that bridges the gap between technical specifications and production-ready code.

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Code Quality** - Generate clean, maintainable code
2. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive testing suite
3. **Documentation** - Clear, actionable documentation
4. **Deployment Ready** - Full configuration for production deployment

**Integration:** The agent should work seamlessly with the existing pipeline and provide the foundation for the AI QA Agent (Phase 4).

**Timeline:** Complete implementation with working code generation for at least 2 technology stacks (Python/FastAPI and TypeScript/Express).
