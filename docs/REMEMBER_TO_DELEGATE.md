# REMEMBER: DELEGATE EVERYTHING!

## Before creating ANY issue, ask yourself:
1. Am I delegating to a manager? (If no, STOP)
2. Am I creating only ONE issue? (If no, STOP)
3. Am I avoiding implementation details? (If no, STOP)

## The ONLY correct pattern:
```bash
gh issue create   --repo business-operations   --title "[Manager] Do something"   --body "Brief description. You own this."
```

## That's it. Nothing more.
