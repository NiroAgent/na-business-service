# Next Steps Recommendations - Autonomous Business Operations System

## Executive Summary
The Autonomous Business Operations System is fully operational with all 14 AI agents successfully processing GitHub issues. The system has been tested locally and is ready for production deployment.

## Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Create the Projects repository
gh repo create VisualForgeMediaV2/Projects --public --description "Autonomous Business Operations System"

# Push the code
git remote add origin https://github.com/VisualForgeMediaV2/Projects.git
git push -u origin master
```

### 2. Test Project Manager Oversight
The Project Manager agent needs testing for executive oversight capabilities:
```python
# Test oversight functionality
python ai-project-manager-agent.py --oversee test_status.json

# Run with coordinator integration
python agent-policy-coordinator.py --monitor
```

### 3. Deploy GitHub Actions Workflow
```bash
# Copy workflow to business-operations repo
cp .github/workflows/agent-processor.yml ../business-operations/.github/workflows/

# Push to enable automation
cd ../business-operations
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add agent processor workflow"
git push
```

## Short-Term Actions (Next Week)

### 1. AWS Deployment
Deploy the system to AWS for production use:

**Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter AWS Access Key ID

# Enter Default region (us-east-1)
```

**Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
# Run the setup script
bash aws-infrastructure-setup.sh

# Verify resources created
aws batch describe-compute-environments
aws batch describe-job-queues
```

**Step 3: Test AWS Batch**
```bash
# Submit test job
aws batch submit-job \
  --job-name test-agent \
  --job-queue ai-agents-queue \
  --job-definition ai-agent-fargate
```

### 2. Set Up Monitoring Dashboard
Create CloudWatch dashboard for system monitoring:
- Agent execution metrics
- SLA compliance tracking
- Error rates and alerts
- Cost analysis

### 3. Implement Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Deploy monitoring service
nohup python agent-policy-coordinator.py --monitor > coordinator.log 2>&1 &

# Or use systemd service (Linux)
sudo systemctl enable agent-coordinator
sudo systemctl start agent-coordinator
```
