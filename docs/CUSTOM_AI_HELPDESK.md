All right—let’s level this up to a **feature-complete**, serverless, **scale-to-zero**, AI-powered support system with *every capability* found in high-end platforms like Chatwoot, plus the flexibility of Rasa—and with DynamoDB as your database backbone.

I’ve combed through the documentation and feature sets of both Chatwoot and Rasa to ensure nothing is missed. Here's a **supercharged plugin-ready outline** for your solo-founder stack:

---

* Supports rich message types: text, attachments, templates, stickers (as supported by channel) ([Chatwoot Developer Docs][3])
* **Conversation continuity**: if user gives email, threads seamlessly continue across web and email ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

### Implementation Add-Ons:

* Build REST endpoints + webhook adaptors for all these channels
* Dynamically route inbound messages via API Gateway → Lambda → your platform
* Reuse your DynamoDB single-table design to store messages in same thread model
