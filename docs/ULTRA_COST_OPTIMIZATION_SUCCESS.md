├── agent-1  (tmux session) → Context retained
├── agent-2  (tmux session) → Context retained  
├── agent-3  (tmux session) → Context retained
├── ...
└── agent-50 (tmux session) → Context retained

### Agent Management (on instance)
```bash
# Switch to agent user
sudo su - agent

# Start all 50 agents
/home/agent/start-all-agents.sh

# Check system status
/home/agent/check-status.sh

# List all running agents  
tmux list-sessions

# Connect to specific agent (retains context)
tmux attach -t agent-5

# Check individual agent status
python3 spot-agent.py --agent-id 5 --status
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# System overview
/home/agent/check-status.sh

# Real-time resource monitoring
htop

# Agent task progress
ls -la /home/agent/state/

# Interruption monitoring
