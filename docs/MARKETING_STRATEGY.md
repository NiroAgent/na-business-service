Got it — you’re a **solo founder**, building your first SaaS on AWS (AI content generation), and your top priority is **automation** so you don’t get buried under marketing tasks.

Here’s how you can structure this so marketing runs mostly on autopilot:

---

## 1. Foundation: Automate the Marketing Stack

Think of it in layers:

* **Website + Landing Pages** → Use **Next.js on AWS Amplify or S3 + CloudFront**. Connect **Vercel AI UI** (since you’re already working with Vercel SDK) for dynamic content. Add **SEO automation** (e.g., SurferSEO or NeuronWriter) so posts and landing pages are optimized by AI without manual tweaking.
* **Email Capture & Sequences** → Plug in **AWS SES + SNS** or use a SaaS like **ActiveCampaign** or **Customer.io**. Automate:

  * Welcome series
  * Drip campaigns
  * Abandoned trial follow-ups
* **Analytics** → **PostHog (self-hostable) or Mixpanel** for product analytics + **Supermetrics** to pull reports automatically into Google Sheets/Looker.

## 2. Customer Acquisition Automation

* **Content Marketing (AI-generated)**

  * Use your own product (dogfooding) + tools like **Jasper** to generate blog posts, tutorials, SEO landing pages.
  * Schedule with **Buffer** or **Publer**.
  * Auto-publish to **LinkedIn, X, TikTok Shorts, YouTube Shorts** with templated video + TTS narrations (you already have TTS).

* **Paid Ads (AI-driven)**

  * Use **Omneky** or **AdCreative.ai** → generate ad creatives + copy automatically, test variations, push to **Google Ads, Meta, TikTok**.
  * Set budgets + let AI optimize.

## 3. Customer Success & Support Automation

* **Helpdesk / Knowledge Base**

  * Use **Document360** or **GitBook** → then connect your own chatbot trained on docs (via **Bedrock / Claude**).
  * This doubles as **self-serve support** → deflects tickets.

* **Support Inbox**

  * Pipe customer emails into **Zendesk + AI auto-responder**.
  * First response drafted by AI, you just approve/escalate.

* **In-App Chatbot**

  * Deploy **Intercom or Crisp** → with AI suggestions + automated onboarding messages.

---

## 4. Billing & Account Management Automation

* **Stripe** for payments + **Kill Bill** or **Chargebee** if you want flexibility later.
* Auto-handle:

  * Trials → Paid
  * Failed payments → Auto-retry + dunning emails
  * Credit usage enforcement (Stripe + AWS metering hooks)

---

## 5. End-to-End Automation Workflow

Here’s how it might look:

1. Visitor lands on **SEO/AI-generated blog page**.
2. Call-to-action → Free trial → Signup (Cognito + Stripe Checkout).
3. Automated onboarding emails via **SES/ActiveCampaign**.
4. Ads run automatically via **Omneky** → tested across channels.
5. Analytics feeds into **Supermetrics** dashboards.
6. Support chatbot answers 80% of customer questions; you only jump in if AI fails.
7. Stripe handles billing, retries, and usage limits.

## 6. Practical “Solo Founder Stack” (minimal overhead)

* **Acquisition** → Omneky (ads) + Buffer (social)
* **Content** → Jasper + your own AI + YouTube Shorts automation
* **CRM/Email** → ActiveCampaign (cheap + easy automation)
* **Support** → Crisp or Intercom + AI chatbot
* **Billing** → Stripe + Webhooks (to your AWS backend)
* **Analytics** → PostHog (self-hosted) or Mixpanel

⚡ **Tip for Solo Ops:**
Document every recurring marketing task you do → then either (1) automate with AI tools, (2) set it on a schedule, or (3) cut it if it doesn’t drive real growth. You’ll end up with a **self-marketing SaaS**.
