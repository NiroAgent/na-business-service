# 🎯 Complete ChatGPT → PM → Development Workflow

## Overview
Your complete software development workflow from ChatGPT brainstorming to AI-powered implementation.

## 🔄 Workflow Steps

### Step 1: ChatGPT Design Session (Visual Forge)
- Use ChatGPT in Visual Forge for interactive brainstorming
- Generate comprehensive design documents with:
  - Requirements and features
  - Technical specifications
  - Business objectives
  - User stories and acceptance criteria

### Step 2: Design Document Import
- **Access**: http://localhost:5005
- Import your ChatGPT design document
- System automatically parses:
  - Requirements from bullet points
  - Technical specifications
  - Business context
  - Feature categorization

### Step 3: PM Workflow Processing
- **Tool**: PM Workflow System (localhost:5005)
- Configure processing options:
  - Feature grouping strategy
  - Story sizing preferences
  - Target release planning
  - Custom PM notes
- Converts requirements into structured:
  - Features with business value
  - Epics for major functionality
  - User stories with story points
  - Acceptance criteria

### Step 4: Feature Management
- **Access**: http://localhost:5004
- Refine and manage created features
- Add detailed acceptance criteria
- Adjust story points and priorities
- Organize into sprints

### Step 5: GitHub Integration
- Export features as GitHub Issues
- AI development team picks up work
- Automated development begins
- Progress tracked in real-time

### Step 6: Monitoring & Coordination
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:5003
- Monitor AI development team
- Track feature progress
- Coordinate between agents
- View system resources

## 🌐 System URLs

| System | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **ChatGPT → PM Workflow** | http://localhost:5005 | Import design docs, PM processing |
| **Feature Management** | http://localhost:5004 | Manage features, epics, stories |
| **Main Dashboard** | http://localhost:5003 | Monitor everything |

## 📋 Example Workflow

### 1. ChatGPT Design Document Example
```
Project: User Authentication System

Requirements:
