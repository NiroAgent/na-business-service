## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

### **For Each Agent, Implement:**

1. **Core Agent Structure:**
   ```python
   class AIAgentName:
       def __init__(self):
           self.agent_id = "ai-agent-name-001"
           self.agent_type = "agent_category"
           self.capabilities = ["capability1", "capability2", ...]
           
           # AWS BACKEND PROCESSING POLICY - MANDATORY
           self.aws_backend_policy = {
               "priority_order": [
                   "AWS Lambda (serverless functions)",
                   "AWS Fargate Tasks (Batch/Step Functions)", 
                   "AWS Fargate Container Service (ECS/EKS)",
                   "EC2 (requires justification)"
               ],
               "default_choice": "AWS Lambda"
           }
   ```

2. **Communication Integration:**
   ```python
   from team_communication_protocol import CommunicationHub
   
   def register_agent(self):
       self.communication_hub.register_agent(
           agent_id=self.agent_id,
           agent_type=self.agent_type,
           capabilities=self.capabilities
       )
   ```

3. **Work Queue Integration:**
   ```python
   from work_queue_manager import WorkQueueManager
   
   def process_work_items(self):
       work_items = self.work_queue.get_work_items(
           agent_type=self.agent_type
       )
   ```

4. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - All agents automatically appear in monitoring dashboard
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket
