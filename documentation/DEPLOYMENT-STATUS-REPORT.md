# Deployment Status Report

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Time**: 03:35 UTC  
**Environment**: vf-dev (AWS Account: 816454053517)

## Summary

Successfully initialized and pushed both projects to GitHub, triggering CI/CD pipelines.

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Repository Initialization
- ‚úÖ NiroSubs-V2: Git repository initialized with dev branch
- ‚úÖ VisualForgeMediaV2: Git repository initialized with dev branch
- ‚úÖ Removed AWS credentials from VisualForgeMediaV2 code

### 2. GitHub Setup
- ‚úÖ Created public repository: https://github.com/stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2
- ‚úÖ Created public repository: https://github.com/stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2
- ‚úÖ Added GitHub secrets:
  - DB_PASSWORD
  - COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID

### 3. Code Push
- ‚úÖ NiroSubs-V2: Pushed to dev branch successfully
- ‚úÖ VisualForgeMediaV2: Pushed to dev branch (after removing credentials)

### 4. Pipeline Execution
- ‚úÖ Both pipelines triggered automatically on push
- **NiroSubs-V2 Pipeline**: https://github.com/stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2/actions
- **VisualForgeMediaV2 Pipeline**: https://github.com/stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2/actions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

### IAM Permission Issue
The pipelines are failing due to IAM role permissions:
- **Error**: `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`
- **Cause**: GitHubActionsRole doesn't exist or isn't properly configured
- **Current User**: S3FullAccess (limited permissions)

### Resolution Options

1. **Option A: Update IAM Configuration** (Requires Admin Access)
   - Create GitHubActionsRole with proper trust policy
   - Configure OIDC provider for GitHub Actions
   - Update role permissions

2. **Option B: Use AWS Access Keys** (Current Workaround)
   - Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as GitHub secrets
   - Update workflows to use credentials instead of OIDC

3. **Option C: Manual Deployment**
   - Use existing deployment scripts locally
   - Deploy using current AWS credentials

## üìä Deployment Metrics

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Git Repositories | ‚úÖ Created | Both repos public on GitHub |
| CI/CD Pipelines | ‚úÖ Configured | Workflows in place |
| Pipeline Execution | ‚ùå Failed | IAM permission issues |
| AWS Infrastructure | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Backend services running from previous deployment |
| Frontend Deployment | ‚ùå Pending | Requires successful pipeline run |

### GitHub Repositories
- NiroSubs-V2: https://github.com/stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2
- VisualForgeMediaV2: https://github.com/stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2

### GitHub Actions (Pipelines)
- NiroSubs-V2: https://github.com/stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2/actions/runs/17016225498
- VisualForgeMediaV2: https://github.com/stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2/actions/runs/17016234061

### AWS Resources (Already Deployed)
- API Gateway: https://c39q8sqdp8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
- CloudFront: https://d26rggx7h06ubr.cloudfront.net

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix IAM Permissions** (One of the following):
   - Get admin access to create GitHubActionsRole
   - Add AWS credentials as GitHub secrets
   - Use local deployment scripts

2. **Re-run Pipelines** after fixing permissions

3. **Verify Deployments** once pipelines succeed

### To Add AWS Credentials to GitHub (Workaround)

```bash
# Add AWS credentials as secrets
gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --body "YOUR_KEY" --repo stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --body "YOUR_SECRET" --repo stevesurles/NiroSubs-V2

gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --body "YOUR_KEY" --repo stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --body "YOUR_SECRET" --repo stevesurles/VisualForgeMediaV2
```

Then update the workflows to use credentials instead of OIDC:
```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

## Conclusion

The repositories are successfully created and code is pushed to GitHub. The CI/CD pipelines are configured and were triggered automatically. However, they failed due to IAM permission issues that need to be resolved before successful deployment.

**Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Blocked** - Requires IAM permission fix

Once the IAM issues are resolved, the pipelines will:
1. Deploy infrastructure to AWS
2. Build and deploy Lambda functions
3. Deploy frontend applications
4. Run integration tests
5. Enable full cross-project integration
