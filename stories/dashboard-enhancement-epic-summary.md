## Technical Architecture

### Backend Requirements
```python
# New API endpoints
GET  /api/costs/environments
GET  /api/costs/breakdown/{environment} 
GET  /api/costs/trends/{environment}
POST /api/agent/{id}/feedback
GET  /api/agent/{id}/context
GET  /api/knowledge-base/search

# WebSocket events
agent_output, agent_status, console_stream
```

### Frontend Components
```javascript
// New React components needed
- EnvironmentCostCard
- CostBreakdownChart  
- ConsoleGrid
- FullScreenConsole
- FeedbackInput
- ContextPanel
- KnowledgeBaseSearch
```

### Infrastructure Updates
- Enhanced WebSocket infrastructure for 50+ concurrent connections
