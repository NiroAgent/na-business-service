# Final Agent Status Report - VF-Dev Complete Coverage

## Executive Summary
Successfully deployed comprehensive AI agents to test ALL services across both visualforgev2 and nirosubsv2 projects in vf-dev environment.

## Current Deployment Status

### EC2 Instance
- **Instance ID**: i-0af59b7036f7b0b77
- **Status**: Active and running
- **Monitoring**: Continuous (updating every 60 seconds)

### Deployed Agents

#### 1. Comprehensive QA Agent
**Status**: Configured and deployed
**Purpose**: Testing ALL services across both projects
**Coverage**:

**VisualForgeV2 Services (10 services)**:
- vf-dashboard-service
- vf-audio-service
- vf-video-service
- vf-image-service
- vf-text-service
- vf-database-service
- vf-analytics-service
- vf-notification-service
- vf-payment-service
- vf-user-service

**NiroSubsV2 Services (8 services)**:
- nirosubs-auth-service
- nirosubs-payment-service
- nirosubs-user-management
- nirosubs-subscription-service
- nirosubs-content-service
- nirosubs-notification-service
- nirosubs-analytics-service
- nirosubs-billing-service

**Testing Methods**:
1. Playwright test file discovery and execution
2. Package.json test script execution
3. API endpoint health checks
4. Service process monitoring

#### 2. Real Developer Agent
**Status**: Deployed
**Purpose**: Bug fixing and remediation
**Features**:
- Monitors GitHub issues for bugs
- Analyzes local failure logs
- Attempts automated bug fixes
- 5-minute monitoring cycles

#### 3. Real Operations Agent
**Status**: Deployed
**Purpose**: System health monitoring
**Features**:
- CPU, memory, disk monitoring
- Agent process tracking
- Alert generation for high resource usage
- 2-minute monitoring cycles

## Testing Coverage

### Test Execution Strategy
The Comprehensive QA Agent uses multiple strategies to ensure complete coverage:

1. **Test File Discovery**:
   - Searches `/opt/{service}/mfe/tests`
   - Searches `/var/www/{service}/mfe/tests`
   - Searches `/home/agent/{service}/mfe/tests`
   - Looks for: *.test.ts, *.spec.ts, *.test.js, *.spec.js

2. **Fallback Testing**:
   - If no test files found, runs `npm test`
   - Tests API health endpoints on common ports
   - Verifies service processes are running

3. **Issue Creation**:
   - Creates GitHub issues for failures (when token available)
   - Logs failures locally to `/opt/ai-agents/logs/`
   - Generates comprehensive test reports

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### Active Components
1. **Background Monitor**: `monitor-ec2-agents.py` (running)
2. **Status File**: `ec2_agent_status.json` (updating every 60 seconds)
3. **Web Dashboard**: `agent-dashboard.html` (available)
4. **Local Dashboard**: Running on http://localhost:5003 (managed by Sonnet)

### Log Files
- `/opt/ai-agents/logs/qa.log` - QA agent activity
- `/opt/ai-agents/logs/dev.log` - Developer agent activity
- `/opt/ai-agents/logs/ops.log` - Operations agent activity
- `/opt/ai-agents/logs/*-failures-*.json` - Test failure reports
- `/opt/ai-agents/logs/comprehensive-report-*.json` - Full test reports

## Test Cycle Timing
- **QA Agent**: Tests all 18 services every 15 minutes
- **Developer Agent**: Checks for bugs every 5 minutes
- **Operations Agent**: Monitors system every 2 minutes

## Key Achievements
✅ Replaced placeholder agents with real test execution
✅ Configured agents for ALL services in both projects
✅ Implemented actual Playwright test execution (not simulated)
✅ Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
✅ Created failure logging and GitHub issue integration
✅ Deployed agents for continuous testing of 18 total services

## Commands for Verification

### Check Running Agents
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0af59b7036f7b0b77 \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["ps aux | grep python3 | grep -v grep"]'
```

### View Test Results
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0af59b7036f7b0b77 \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["ls -la /opt/ai-agents/logs/"]'
```

### Check Specific Service Testing
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0af59b7036f7b0b77 \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["grep vf-dashboard-service /opt/ai-agents/logs/qa.log | tail -5"]'
```

## Summary
All agents are deployed and configured to actively test EVERY service in vf-dev across both the visualforgev2 and nirosubsv2 projects. The system is now continuously:
- Running tests on 18 services
- Creating issues for failures
- Monitoring system health
- Attempting bug fixes

The placeholder agents that were just sleeping have been completely replaced with real, functional agents that execute actual tests and provide genuine value.
