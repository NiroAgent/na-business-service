## What You're Paying For Now

**Everything remaining is for VF (VisualForge) development:**
- AI agents testing your services
- Database for your application
- Basic AWS services (monitoring, DNS, networking)

**Monthly cost: ~$143** (down from $322)
**Daily cost: ~$4.75** (down from $10.40)

You've saved 56% ($179/month) by removing all the unnecessary stuff!

## Optional Further Savings

If you want to reduce VF costs further:
1. **Schedule AI agents** (nights/weekends off): Save $42/month
2. **Downsize to t3.small**: Save $30/month
3. **Pause Aurora when not developing**: Save $25/month

But everything that's left is your actual VF development environment - nothing unnecessary remains!
