### Objective
Establish a mandatory architectural review gate for all PM-created features and stories before they are assigned to developer, DevOps, and QA agents.

### Review Process Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PM Creates Feature/Story] --> B[Architect Review Queue]
    B --> C{{Architect Reviews}}
    C -->|Approved| D[Add Architecture Guidance]
    C -->|Needs Changes| E[Return to PM with Feedback]
    D --> F[Assign to Dev/DevOps/QA]
    E --> A
    F --> G[Implementation]
    G --> H[Architect Final Review]
    H -->|Pass| I[Deploy]
    H -->|Fail| F
```

### Architectural Standards Document

See architectural-standards.json for detailed standards.

### Review Responsibilities

#### 1. Initial Review (Pre-Implementation)
- **Timing**: Before any development begins
- **Duration**: Within 4 hours of story creation
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Architectural alignment
  - Technical feasibility
  - Security implications
  - Performance impact
  - Integration considerations

#### 2. Technical Guidance Addition
For each approved story, architect must add:

```markdown
## Architectural Guidance

### Technical Approach
- Recommended design pattern: [Pattern Name]
- Technology stack: [Specific technologies]
- Integration points: [Services/APIs to integrate]

### Implementation Guidelines
1. [Specific technical requirement 1]
2. [Specific technical requirement 2]
3. [Specific technical requirement 3]

### Quality Requirements
- Code coverage: >= X%
- Performance: [Specific metrics]
- Security: [Specific controls]

### Review Checkpoints
- [ ] Design review completed
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Security review approved
- [ ] Performance testing done
```

#### 3. Continuous Review During Implementation
- Daily review of in-progress work
- Immediate feedback on architectural deviations
- Guidance on technical challenges
- Approval of technical decisions

#### 4. Final Review (Pre-Deployment)
- Verify architectural compliance
- Performance validation
- Security assessment
- Documentation completeness
- Operational readiness

### Automated Review System

```python
class ArchitectReviewBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.review_queue = []
        self.standards = load_architectural_standards()
    
    def auto_review(self, story):
        violations = []
        recommendations = []
        
        # Check for architectural patterns
        if not self.contains_pattern_reference(story):
            violations.append("No architectural pattern specified")
            recommendations.append("Add pattern: Repository, CQRS, etc.")
        
        # Check for security considerations
        if not self.contains_security_section(story):
            violations.append("Missing security requirements")
            recommendations.append("Add security controls section")
        
        # Check for performance criteria
        if not self.contains_performance_metrics(story):
            violations.append("No performance criteria defined")
            recommendations.append("Add SLA and performance targets")
        
        return {{
            "status": "needs_review" if violations else "pre_approved",
            "violations": violations,
            "recommendations": recommendations
        }}
```

### Review Criteria

### Story Review Template

```yaml
story_review:
  story_id: "STORY-123"
  title: "Story Title"
  review_date: "2024-01-20"
  reviewer: "ai-architect-agent"

    scalability: PASS/FAIL
    observability: PASS/FAIL
  
  technical_guidance:
    pattern: "Repository Pattern with CQRS"
    stack:
      - backend: "Python FastAPI"
      - database: "PostgreSQL with Redis cache"
      - messaging: "AWS SQS"
    
  risks:
    - description: "High database load"
      mitigation: "Implement caching layer"
    
  dependencies:
    - service: "auth-service"
      type: "API call"
    - service: "notification-service"
      type: "Event publish"
  
  approval_status: "APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS"
  conditions:
    - "Add rate limiting"
    - "Implement circuit breaker"
    - "Add distributed tracing"
```

### Integration with Agent Workflow

#### 1. PM Agent Workflow Update
```python
def create_story(story_details):
    # Create story in GitHub
    story = create_github_issue(story_details)
    
    # Submit for architect review
    review_request = {
        "story_id": story.number,
        "type": "initial_review",
        "priority": story.priority
    }
    submit_for_review(review_request)
    
    # Wait for approval
    approval = wait_for_architect_approval(story.number)
    
    if approval.status == "approved":
        # Assign to implementation agents
        assign_to_agents(story, approval.technical_guidance)
    else:
        # Revise based on feedback
        revise_story(story, approval.feedback)
```

#### 2. Developer Agent Workflow Update
```python
def process_story(story):
    # Check for architect approval
    if not has_architect_approval(story):
        log("Story not approved by architect")
        return
    
    # Get architectural guidance
    guidance = get_architectural_guidance(story)
    
    # Implement following guidelines
    implementation = implement_with_standards(story, guidance)
    
    # Request architecture review
    request_implementation_review(implementation)
```

#### 3. DevOps Agent Workflow Update
```python
def deploy_service(service):
    # Verify architectural compliance
    compliance = verify_architecture_compliance(service)
    
    if not compliance.passed:
        log(f"Failed compliance: {compliance.violations}")
        return
    
    # Deploy with architectural standards
    deploy_with_standards(service)
```

### Monitoring and Metrics

#### Review Metrics
- Average review time: < 4 hours
- Approval rate: Track trends
- Revision cycles: Minimize iterations
- Standards violations: Track and reduce
- Implementation success rate: > 95%

#### Compliance Dashboard
```javascript
const complianceDashboard = {
    stories_reviewed: 150,
    approved_first_pass: 120,
    required_revision: 30,
    average_review_time: "3.2 hours",
    compliance_rate: "94%",
    
    common_violations: [
        "Missing security requirements: 15%",
        "No performance criteria: 12%",
        "Unclear service boundaries: 8%"
    ],
    
    improvement_trends: {
        week_1: "78%",
        week_2: "85%",
        week_3: "91%",
        week_4: "94%"
    }
};
```

### Escalation Process

1. **Standard Review**: 4-hour SLA
2. **Expedited Review**: 1-hour SLA for P0 items
3. **Emergency Override**: For critical production issues
4. **Review Board**: Weekly meeting for complex decisions

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All stories reviewed before implementation
- [ ] 95% first-pass approval rate achieved
- [ ] Zero architectural debt introduced
- [ ] 100% compliance with standards
- [ ] Clear technical guidance provided

### Assigned Agents
- **Lead**: ai-architect-agent
- **Support**: ai-tech-lead-agent
- **Coordination**: ai-project-manager-agent

### Priority: P0 (Critical - Must be implemented immediately)
### Implementation: Immediate effect on all new stories

### Notes
- This process is mandatory and cannot be bypassed
- Architects have veto power over implementations
- Regular standards updates based on lessons learned
- Automated tools to assist manual reviews

#### 2. Agent Processing Monitor
```python
class AgentProcessingMonitor:
    def monitor_agent_compliance(self):
        # Track agent activities
        agent_metrics = {
            'developer': {
                'stories_received': count,
                'stories_completed': count,
                'standards_compliance': percentage
            },
            'devops': {
                'deployments': count,
                'failed_deployments': count,
                'infrastructure_compliance': percentage
            },
            'qa': {
                'tests_created': count,
                'tests_executed': count,
                'coverage_achieved': percentage
            }
        }
```

#### 3. Real-time Compliance Dashboard
- PM story creation rate
- Architect review queue depth
- Agent processing status
- Standards violation alerts
- Success/failure rates

### Alert Conditions
1. Story created without acceptance criteria
2. Agent processing without architect approval
3. Deployment without passing tests
4. Standards violations detected
5. SLA breaches

### Priority: P0 (Critical)
