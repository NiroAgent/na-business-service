### Executive Summary
Our autonomous business system is experiencing critical Unicode encoding failures on Windows. As Project Manager, you will coordinate a complete migration to WSL/Linux, delegating specific tasks to specialized agents.

### Business Impact
- **Current State**: System partially operational due to encoding errors
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Blocking agent operations
- **Solution**: Migrate to Linux environment
- **Timeline**: 8 hours maximum

### Your Management Responsibilities

#### 1. Project Planning (Hour 1)
Create a detailed project plan with:
- Milestone definitions
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Communication plan
- Success metrics

#### 2. Team Assembly & Delegation

##### Create GitHub Issues for Each Agent:

**For IT Infrastructure Agent:**
```
Title: [IT-Agent] Execute WSL Environment Setup and Migration
Tasks:
- Install and configure WSL2
- Setup Linux environment
- Migrate files from Windows
- Install system dependencies
- Configure networking
Deadline: 3 hours
```

**For DevOps Agent:**
```
Title: [DevOps] Configure Services and Automation for Linux
Tasks:
- Setup Python virtual environments
- Configure systemd services
- Implement monitoring
- Setup log management
- Create backup procedures
Deadline: 2 hours
```

**For QA Agent:**
```
Title: [QA] Validate Migration and System Functionality
Tasks:
- Test Unicode support
- Validate all agent operations
- Performance testing
- Security scanning
- Create test reports
Deadline: 2 hours
```

**For Developer Agent:**
```
Title: [Developer] Adapt Code for Linux Environment
Tasks:
- Fix any Linux-specific issues
- Update file paths
- Modify scripts for bash
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
Deadline: 2 hours
```

#### 3. Coordination Matrix

```
Phase 1 (Hours 1-3): Infrastructure Setup
- Lead: IT Agent
- Support: DevOps Agent
- Deliverable: Working WSL environment

Phase 2 (Hours 3-5): Migration & Configuration  
- Lead: DevOps Agent
- Support: IT Agent, Developer Agent
- Deliverable: Migrated and configured system

Phase 3 (Hours 5-7): Testing & Validation
- Lead: QA Agent
- Support: All agents
- Deliverable: Validated system

Phase 4 (Hour 8): Go-Live & Documentation
- Lead: Manager (you)
- Support: All agents
- Deliverable: Operational system on Linux
```

#### 4. Communication Protocol

**Status Updates Required:**
- Every hour: Progress report from each agent
- Every 2 hours: Management summary to stakeholders
- Immediately: Any blockers or critical issues
- Completion: Full migration report

**Escalation Path:**
1. Agent encounters blocker → Reports to Manager
2. Manager assesses impact → Reallocates resources
3. Critical issues → Escalate to Architect
4. Business impact → Notify PM leadership

#### 5. Resource Management

**Resource Allocation:**
- IT Agent: 40% of effort (infrastructure)
- DevOps Agent: 30% of effort (configuration)
- QA Agent: 20% of effort (validation)
- Developer Agent: 10% of effort (code fixes)

**Budget Considerations:**
- WSL2: Free (included with Windows)
- Ubuntu: Free
- Tools: Open source (no cost)
- Time: 8 person-hours total

#### 6. Risk Management

**Identified Risks & Mitigation:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| WSL installation fails | Low | High | Fallback to VM |
| File permissions issues | Medium | Medium | IT Agent expertise |
| Service startup failures | Medium | Medium | DevOps automation |
| Network connectivity | Low | High | Firewall rules |
| Data loss during migration | Low | Critical | Backup first |

#### 7. Success Criteria

**Must Have (P0):**
- [ ] All agents running on Linux
- [ ] Unicode fully functional
- [ ] GitHub integration working
- [ ] Zero data loss

**Should Have (P1):**
- [ ] Automated startup
- [ ] Log aggregation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Performance improvement

**Nice to Have (P2):**
- [ ] Docker containers
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Disaster recovery

#### 8. Decision Authority

As Project Manager, you have authority to:
- Reassign tasks between agents
- Adjust timeline within 8-hour window
- Request additional resources
- Make technical decisions
- Approve go-live

#### 9. Reporting Requirements

Create these reports:
1. **Kickoff Report** - Project plan and assignments
2. **Progress Reports** - Hourly status updates
3. **Issue Log** - Track and resolve problems
4. **Testing Report** - QA validation results
5. **Completion Report** - Final summary and lessons learned

#### 10. Post-Migration Tasks

After successful migration:
1. Document new procedures
2. Update runbooks
3. Train team on Linux operations
4. Plan optimization phase
5. Schedule retrospective

### Delegation Script

Create `manager-migration-coordination.py`:

```python
