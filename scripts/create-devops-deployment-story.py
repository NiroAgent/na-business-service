### **Logging:**
- [ ] Application logs aggregation
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Cost monitoring event logs
- [ ] Kill switch activation logs

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### **Rollback Plan:**
- [ ] Document current application version

**üö® CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:**
The kill switch functionality MUST be thoroughly tested in vf-dev before staging deployment. This system has the ability to automatically shutdown all agents and requires careful validation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER:**
This deployment cannot proceed until GitHub Issue #9 (QA Testing) is marked complete and the kill switch safety has been validated.

**üéØ Success Definition:**
Deployment is considered successful when both vf-dev and vf-staging environments are running the enhanced dashboard with all 7 tabs functional, cost monitoring active, and kill switch tested and operational.
